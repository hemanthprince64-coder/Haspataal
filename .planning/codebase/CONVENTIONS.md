# Coding Conventions

## Language
- **JavaScript** (based on `.js` extensions observed).
- *Recommendation: Migrate to TypeScript for better type safety given the complexity.*

## Styling
- Inline styles are heavily used in `page.js` (ref: recent edits).
- CSS Modules or Tailwind might be present but inline styles are dominant in reviewed files.

## Component Structure
- Functional Components using Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- Separation of Client (`'use client'`) and Server Components.
