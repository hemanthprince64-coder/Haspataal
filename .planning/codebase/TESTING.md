# Testing Strategy

## Current State
- **Unit Tests:** None observed (no `test` script in `package.json` or `__tests__` directory seen).
- **E2E Tests:** None observed.

## Recommendations
- Install Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests.
- Consider Playwright/Cypress for E2E testing critical flows (booking, search).
